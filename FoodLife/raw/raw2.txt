FOOD Share – Shelf Life Guide
FOOD Share, Ventura County’s Food
Bank, often receives donations of food
items after the date on the package
has expired. In most cases, this food is
still safe to eat! Food manufacturers
use different date codes to ensure that
consumers receive their product at
peak quality. Once a product is past
code date, many manufacturers
donate it to food banks. Some foods
deteriorate quickly, while the quality
of other items may last longer than
expected. This is why the storage
times listed in the accompanying
charts are intended as useful
guidelines, not hard and fast rules.
Coded Dates
Coded dates (packing numbers) may
appear on shelf-stable products such as
cans and boxes of food. This enables
manufacturers to rotate their stock, as
well as locate their products in the
event of a recall.
Calendar code dates help stores
determine how long to display the
product for sale and relate to the peak
quality of food, not safety. Calendar
code dates are found primarily on
perishable foods, such as dairy,
products, eggs, meat and poultry.
Four ways products are dated:
•“Sell-by” date – tells the store how
long to display the product for sale.
•“Best if Used By (or Before)” –
recommended for best flavor or quality.
It is not a purchase or safety date.
•“Use By” – the last date
recommended for use of the product
while at peak quality. The
manufacturer of the product has
determined the date.
*When freezing egg yolks, beat in either 1/8 teaspoon salt or 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar or
corn syrup per 1/4 cup egg yolks (4 yolks).

•“Exp. (or Expires)” – this is a true
expiration date. The food is not safe to
eat and must be thrown away.
STORING REFRIGERATED FOOD
• Leave meat, poultry and seafood in the
store packaging before using. Repeated
handling can introduce bacteria into
products.
• Store opened food in foil, plastic
wrap, leak-proof plastic bags or air-
tight, food storage containers to keep
food from drying out.
• Place meat, poultry and seafood in
the coldest part of the refrigerator. Store
eggs in their original carton on a shelf,
not in the door.
• Defrost or marinate meat in the re-
frigerator – never on the kitchen
counter.
• Place meat, poultry and seafood
items on the lowest shelf to minimize
leakage onto other stored foods.
• Clean the refrigerator regularly to
remove spoiled food, odors and bac-
teria. Don’t overload the refrigerator.
Air must circulate freely to cool all
foods evenly.
HANDLING FOOD SAFELY
AT HOME
Many cases of foodborne illness occur
each year due to improper handling
of food in the home. Microorganisms
multiply rapidly at temperatures be-
tween 40ºF and 140ºF. Unfortunately,
the harmful bacteria that cause most
cases of foodborne illness cannot be
seen, smelled or tasted. Therefore, it’s
important to:
Keep Cold foods Cold
(40o
F or below)
and Hot foods Hot
(140o
F or above).
and follow these additional rules
1. CLEAN: Wash hands and surfaces
often and thoroughly.
2. SEPARATE: Don't cross-contaminate.
3. COOK: Cook to proper temperatures.
4. CHILL: Refrigerate promptly. (after
home cooking) 3-4 days refrigerated
or 2-3 months frozen.

*It is recommended to blanch (partially cook) or cook vegetables before freezing.
Raw fruit and vegetables can be held
at room temperature, stored in the
refrigerator or frozen. For most
produce, refrigeration is the best
way to maintain quality and delay
ripening. There are, however, some
exceptions:
•Tomatoes taste best if not refrig-
erated. Cold storage can cause them
to become mealy.
•Bananas should not be refrigerated
unless fully ripe, and then they
should be used within 1-2 days.
Refrigeration will cause banana skin
to blacken, but the fruit will not
ripen while cold.
•If they are very fresh, apples,
mangoes, and stone fruits (plums,
peaches, etc.) can be stored at room
temperature, but these items should
be refrigerated as they ripen.
•Hardy vegetables like onions, garlic,
potatoes, sweet potatoes, and
winter squash can be stored in cool,
dark places outside of the cooler.
OTHER TIPS:
 Wash produce under running
water before preparation
 Once fruits and vegetables are
cut, chopped or cooked, they
should be placed in the
refrigerator within two hours, or
frozen in plastic freezer
containers.
 Cutting boards can be a source
of bacterial contamination, so
it’s a good idea to use different
cutting boards, for raw meat and
poultry, produce and ready-to-
eat foods.
FROZEN FOODS
Because foods frozen at peak quality will
taste better than foods frozen near the end
of their useful life, quickly freeze items
you don’t plan to use in the next day or
two. Keep the freezer temperature at 0ºF
or below; frozen food quality deteriorates
more rapidly above 0ºF.

Defrosting
Never defrost foods outdoors, in a cold
room in the house, such as the basement,
or on the kitchen counter. These methods
encourage growth of harmful bacteria.
• There are three ways to defrost food: in
the refrigerator, in a sealed package in cold
water, and in the microwave oven. Never
defrost or thaw a food product by leaving
it out on the kitchen counter.
• Food thawed in the refrigerator can be
refrozen without cooking. Plan ahead be-
cause food may take several hours to thaw
in the refrigerator (or even days for tur-
keys).
• Foods defrosted in cold water or in the
microwave should be cooked immediately.
DELI FOODS
Your supermarket deli maintains rigid
quality assurance and sanitation standards
to ensure you will always receive fresh,
wholesome products.
• As soon as you get home, immediately
put cold perishables into the refrigerator
or freezer.
• Hot perishable foods from the deli de-
partment need to be kept at 140oF or
above, or consumed within two hours.
• For hot deli foods to be eaten at a later
time, place them in shallow, covered con-
tainers and refrigerate or freeze within two
hours.
• Reheat foods to 165ºF.

Shelf-stable foods such as canned
goods, cereal, baking mixes, pasta,
dry beans, mustard, ketchup and
peanut butter can be kept safely at
room temperature.
To keep these foods at their best
quality, store them in clean, dry, cool
(below 85°F) cabinets away from the
stove or the refrigerator’s exhaust.
Extremely hot (over 100°F) and
freezing temperatures are harmful to
canned goods.
In general, most canned foods have a
long shelf life, and when properly
stored, can be eaten for several years:
•Low-acid canned goods – two to five
years (canned meat and poultry,
stews, soups except tomato, pasta
products, potatoes, corn, carrots,
spinach, beans, beets, peas and
pumpkin).
•High-acid canned goods – 12 to 18
months (tomato products, fruits,
sauerkraut and foods in vinegar-based
sauces or dressings).
Some canned hams are shelf-stable.
Never store ham or any foods labeled
“keep refrigerated” in the pantry.
These foods must be stored in the
refrigerator.
Many shelf-stable foods remain
edible for several weeks, or even
months, after opening, as the
accompanying chart indicates.
However, be sure to read package
labels. Some items must be
refrigerated after opening.
Do Not Consume Food from Cans or Jars If:
•Leaking or stained
•Swollen can
•Rusty
•Badly dented, crimped or pinched
•Container is cracked
•Foul odor
•Safety seals are broken or missing
•Lids are loose or missing
•Foods exhibit changed color or odor –
•NEVER TASTE SUSPICIOUS FOODS!
Do Not Consume Food from Boxes If:
Inside bag:
•Is torn or leaking
•Seals are ripped
•Has moldy or foreign objects inside
Box without an inside bag:
•Is open or torn
•Is stained or wet
•Has live or dead insects, webs, or droppings
Tips on Storing Canned and Boxed Food:
 Store cans and boxes off the floor, either on a
pallet or shelf and 18 inches away from the
wall so air can circulate
 Store canned and boxed goods in a clean, dry,
and cool area (below 85°F).
 Extremely hot (over 100°F) and cold (below
30°F) temperatures can damage canned goods
and shorten shelf life.
 Always rotate your stock – First in-First out!
